        "Urban areas are characterized by high population. In recent years, rural-urban migration has contributed to rapid growth of urban population, consequently resulting in the mushrooming of slums. These slums are characterized by poor housing and sanitation, absence of clean water, electricity and other basic necessities. There is need to acquire spatial information to accurately determine the geographic location of these slum areas, to allow the local governments and concerned bodies formulate slum rehabilitation policies.
